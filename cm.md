<h2> Intro to 3D Printing </h2>

<p>For this second session of community engagement, I went somewhere <br>
completely out of my comfort zone.  I attended the BEAM __“Intro to 3D <br>
Printing”__ workshop in the Kenan Science Library.  Since I knew nothing <br>
about 3D printing I decided this would be a great place to start. </p>
<br>
<p>The Kenan Makerspace currently contains four different
<a href= "http://library.unc.edu/makerspace/equipment-software/">3D Printers</a>.<br>  
Two of them were running during our workshop, most likely creating objects <br>
for students or faculty that had placed an order online.  As a student we <br>
are able to order 3D objects to be printed free of charge, although any <br>
items ordered for classes or research are a higher priority than any leisure <br>
projects.</p>
<br>
The uPrint SE Plus <img src="/css/3d printer.jpg"  alt="3D Printer" border="1"> <br> 
is special because it uses a different kind of plastic than the other <br>
printers.  ABS plastic is unique because excess “support” that is printed <br>
with a given object can be removed by placing the object in a chemical <br>
solution.  (**“Support”** is a slightly different kind of material that <br> 
is used to fill in certain areas of the object).  Instead of having to <br>
manually remove excess **“support”** it can just be dissolved!<br>
<br>
We also covered some basic information regarding 3D design.  
As beginners, we were directed to <a href= "https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingaverse</a>,which, as one of my fellow <br>
workshop-mates stated, is the <a href= "https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a> of  3D printing.  <br>
Thingiverse is a collection of 3D objects that has been created by <br>
designers of all kinds.  The _.stl_ files that contain the specifics <br> 
of each object are available for anyone that wants to duplicate or <br>
modify the designs on this website.  If I wanted to have an object printed for <br>
myself, all I need to do is find something that I would like to have made <br>
and submit the files and a <a href= "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfWHSCBVDBoW5cc4iUqbcAqyu-GCS1sGZzdG3J4QtRXMuu-g/viewform"> 3D Printing Request</a> to Makerspace.  
<br>
I’m thinking this may actually be a perfect present for my dad!<i class="fa fa-gift" aria-hidden="true"></i>

<h2>Skillful Tech Workshop</h2>
<p>Tonight I attended the “Design a Flyer in Photoshop” workshop in the <br>
Undergraduate Library. (I was surprised to walk into the lab and discover <br>
that I recognized the instructor because she was a librarian at A-B Tech when<br> 
I attended there from 2014-2015.) This session was designed to be an <br>
introduction to Adobe Photoshop and simply walked through the basics of <br>
designing a flyer for a bake sale incorporating images, text, and shapes.</p>
<br>
<p>I had used Adobe Photoshop several years ago but, given my lack of <br>
artistic ability, my work was never that great. Nevertheless, the ability <br>
to navigate Photoshop and create even simple projects can prove quite <br>
useful. It was helpful to work in Adobe’s newest edition of Photoshop for <br>
the first time and to find out I can order it as a student for free, which <br>
I am doing as I write this. Having the software on my personal computer <br>
will enable me to play around when I have more time to explore. I also <br>
thought going through a refresher in Photoshop might assist me with future <br>
projects as a student assistant in SILS. </p>
<br>
<p> The tips I found most helpful came at the conclusion of the session. <br>
The instructor shared several sites with us that contain images we can <br>
include in our work on Adobe or in other projects, my favorite of which <br>
was <a href= "https://thenounproject.com">The Noun Project</a>. Because I 
am currently developing a web page <br>
for this class it was helpful to discover where I could find some <br>
really unique and fun graphics that I could incorporate into my own <br>
assignments. </p>
