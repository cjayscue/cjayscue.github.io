<h2>Skillful Tech Workshop</h2>
<p>Tonight I attended the “Design a Flyer in Photoshop” workshop in the <br>
Undergraduate Library. (I was surprised to walk into the lab and discover <br>
that I recognized the instructor because she was a librarian at A-B Tech when<br> 
I attended there from 2014-2015.) This session was designed to be an <br>
introduction to Adobe Photoshop and simply walked through the basics of <br>
designing a flyer for a bake sale incorporating images, text, and shapes.</p>
<br>
<p>I had used Adobe Photoshop several years ago but, given my lack of <br>
artistic ability, my work was never that great. Nevertheless, the ability <br>
to navigate Photoshop and create even simple projects can prove quite <br>
useful. It was helpful to work in Adobe’s newest edition of Photoshop for <br>
the first time and to find out I can order it as a student for free, which <br>
I am doing as I write this. Having the software on my personal computer <br>
will enable me to play around when I have more time to explore. I also <br>
thought going through a refresher in Photoshop might assist me with future <br>
projects as a student assistant in SILS. </p>
<br>
<p> The tips I found most helpful came at the conclusion of the session. <br>
The instructor shared several sites with us that contain images we can <br>
include in our work on Adobe or in other projects, my favorite of which <br>
was <a href= "https://thenounproject.com">The Noun Project</a>. Because I 
am currently developing a web page <br>
for this class it was helpful to discover where I could find some <br>
really unique and fun graphics that I could incorporate into my own <br>
assignments. </p>
