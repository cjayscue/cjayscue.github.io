title:  Assignment 5 (aka The Struggle)
---

I just reviewed the script that we labored over as a group for the past couple
of weeks, and I can't help but feel a little bit __proud__.  This assignment was 
a challenge for the three of us, but now it is done and working exactly as it
should (with a little ```swankification``` thrown on top).

In a nutshell, our script (with the help of the README) asks the user to input 
their username and password followed by a series of questions.  Once all of the 
questions are answered, they are *inserted* into a table that has been previously
created in SQL.  The script also dumps the input into an sql file so that the 
responses can be imported by another user (and that import command is also included
in the script).

I'm not going to lie.  This assignment had me like...

As a group, we were essentially stymied for almost the entire class on Monday,
November 14th and for most of the class today.  We tried so many combinations in
our script and nothing worked.  Our table disappeared on Monday, and even though
it initially showed up today it disappeared all over again...__twice__...!

Even though we were able to get it working, after guidance, we were all so 
frazzled we weren't sure what was the problem the whole time (it may have been
the lack of table but we don't know why the tables kept disappearing).  Even though
I made of use of <a href= "https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>, because
I don't have a thorough understanding of scripting and syntax, I was never entirely
sure what I was reading or testing.  In many ways, the assignment kind of felt like a guessing 
game.  Even though I understand basic Java programming and I've taken a database 
class in Access, I could not figure out a way to connect the dots to the command line.

On a positive note, I am thankful for my group and for the opportunity to work
with them a second time.  It was great to have classmates to bounce ideas off of 
and to share tips and concepts with.  Once we got over the hurdle of the intial 
script, we were able to work together very quickly to pull the rest of the assignment
together!<i class="fa fa-hand-spock-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>
