When I initially heard that this was going to be a ```group project```, I was less than thrilled.
The older I get the more introverted I've become, so I tend to dislike that 
type of assignment.

However, once I settled into my group I actually started to enjoy myself.  Most of the 
steps we worked together but a few of the simpler ones we did individually and then just
informed our group-mates that they could pull the change.  (For example, I took care
of creating the **Prep** folder and moving files into it.)

We developed the questions and format of the script as a team while Reagan tracked down what we needed for
a time stamp and Celine discovered how to insert a unique ID.  Even though sharing and merging got a bit messy at times, it was great to see how we 
could work together both *on-screen* and *off-screen* in a collaborative way.  The first time we had a <a href= "https://github.com/celineyuwono/mcrgirls-assignment-4/commit/99ac67b515e3c18866ab3bb18df8c18609b08b3b">merge conflict</a>, Professor Hauser
walked us through what we needed to do to get things back in order.  But the second time we had a <a href= "https://github.com/celineyuwono/mcrgirls-assignment-4/commit/c9456fd91468cfc79aba94347f82beb155a4aa98">one</a> we were able
to solve it ourselves!

I wanted to add a ***splash*** of color to our script so I made each question a different color.
It was really cool that my group-mates could just pull that change right to their own workspace.

Even though this assignment was quick it was still incredibly beneficial.  I realize I was given my group members
according to a random assignment, but I definitely think I lucked out.
I've peeked ahead and am glad to see our next assignment is also a group project!
