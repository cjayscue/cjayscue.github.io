Well, the day has come.  It's time to publish my blog post on the world wide web.  
The problem is I'm not entirely sure **where** this post is going to show up on
my website.  However, I feel certain that will be addressed very soon. =)

This class has proven to be quite a ```challenge for me```.  There is very little
we have covered in the past few weeks that I would have considered "prior knowledge".
And yet, when I understand what we are doing in class I genuinely have 
fun.  The time in this class passes more quickly than in any other class I am
taking this semester, which says quite a bit especially because it is in the 
late afternoon!

I hope to be much quicker and to understand the fundamentals of this class more
thoroughly by the end of this semester.  _Here's_ to making my first web page!
