<h2><a href="https://cjayscue.github.io/assignment-6/">What You Should Know About Search</a></h2>

The semester has finally come to an end and we've concluded our time in this class
with a project that combines all that we have learned throughout the semester. 
Our presentation may not be the best one in the class, but a great deal of 
time and effort was put into it and I am extremely proud of the final outcome <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>


> Who did what in your project

Since I came with the topic, I did the bulk of the research and slide assembly.
Ironically enough, I initially thought I knew a good bit about the topic my 
partner and I decided upon, but I ended up researching and learning much more 
about information retrieval models than I had anticipated.

We figured out the the recording process with **Audacity** together and spent 
time outside of class (in a quiet place) to get our recordings done.  

Once I completed **presentation.md**, I was able to begin formatting the slides
individually in **index.html**.  The realization hit me early on that it was 
much easier to get the substance of our presentation done in markdown before
making additional changes in .html.

Together, we found photos to place on the slides and decided on a fluid color
and text scheme.  Since Sanjana was experiencing some issues with GitHub, I 
did my best to finish things up and pass the project along to <br>
her. <i class="fa fa-share" aria-hidden="true"></i>


> What your process was like

1. First, we picked a topic.  Information Retrieval was a topic I enjoyed covering 
in my 201 class, so I thought it would be an interesting topic to present on.
As I mentioned above, I certainly discovered how much I had left to learn about
IR!
2. The research continued through the slide-assembly process until Sanjana and I
were able to tie everything together and finish adding content.
3. My partner and I got together over the weekend to record audio for each of 
our slides.  We definitely made some errors and had to re-record quite a few 
segments, but thankfully we were able to get them done and uploaded to Cloud9.
4. Once final edits were made in presentation.md, we ran the script and created
index.html.  
5. Our final step was to add color and life to our presentation.  Since we had 
almost 40 slides it took a good while to accomplish everything we wanted to, but
we got it done. I really tried to add humor, even cheesy humor, to our presentation
to make it engaging and entertaining for our audience.

> Any lightbulbs that came on for you

The biggest  <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>  I experienced 
happened yesterday.  I was hacking away at my computer when all of a sudden
I realized, "Hey! I've learned a lot of crap this semester". There is SO much 
I don't understand about scripting or SQL, but I do know the basics of working 
on the command line and even how to solve problems (such as merge conflicts) on 
my own.  

As I worked on formatting our presentation I began to memorize quite a bit of
the syntax such as ```data-background-image="" or style="color:black;"```.  This
not only made working in index.html go more quickly but it also
enabled me to troubleshoot small errors.  Given how slow and confused I was when
we created our website earlier in the semester, it feels great to understand 
these important basics.

> Any challenges you overcame

When we initially began this project I did not think things were going to go 
very well.  Since it was the end of the semester and tasks were piling on left 
and right, I was truly concerned I would not be able to pull it together.

Thankfully, after many mistakes and much time spent reading and re-reading 
the <a href="https://silshack.github.io/inls161fall2016/present/2016/11/30/recording-and-editing-audio/">instructions</a> 
the pieces began to come together.  I knew that I could not complete this assignment
quickly because I was learning as I went(both about the topic and reveal.js) so
I just had to make the decision to dedicate the time and effort to fully grasp
the material.

It was a huge relief for the audio and video we uploaded to work smoothly with
no glitches!

> How this project used various skills and attitudes you've developed over the course of this class

This final assignment was a culmination of all we have covered over the semester 
in INLS 161.  This was not the case only in material/applications (such as github and 
Cloud9) but also in the spirit of the course.  Over the past few months we have
gradually been forced to be more and more independent and inventive in the way
we learn and apply our knowledge.

I am not accustomed to this method of pedagogy, but it has certainly encouraged
me to work harder and to be more of an "investigative learner".  It hasn't been
easy - but it has been good for me.

> How you might use these skills and attitudes in your future studies or career 

Even though reaveal.js is a more time-consuming way to create presentations
they absolutely look a heck of a lot better than anything made in PowerPoint! After 
my upcoming trip to Puerto Rico I am required to create a presentation and I hope to use
reveal.js to accomplish this task.  I'm not sure when I will work on the command 
line again **but** I am glad to be familiar with how it works.

I have no doubt that if I can improve in my ablility to learn independently then that
skill will serve me well as I progress through college and onto a career.  It is 
far to0 easy to underestimate myself and automatically assume that I am not 
able to accomplish something. This class and this first semester at UNC have 
enabled me to have more confidence and to take more initiative. <i class="fa fa-magic" aria-hidden="true"></i>
